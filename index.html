    <h1>I Love You Baby Girl Ko!</h1>
    <p>You always thought i was trying to argue but I was just trying to tell i feel</p>
    <p>I wasn't looking for a fight I was looking for understanding</p>
    <p>for you to see the things i coudn't put into perfect words</p>
    <p>my frustration wasn't anger it was hurt the kind that comes from feeling unseen</p>
    <p>unheard or misunderstood I tried to explain myself but maybe I said too much or not enough</p>
    <p>maybe my tone betrayed me or my emotions got tangled up in the words</p>
    <p>but all i ever wanted was for you to listen not to defend yourself or fix things</p>
    <p>just to hear me to know that my feelings matter to you even if they didn't always make sense</p>
    <p>I never wanted us to drift apart over misunderstandings i just wanted us to be close enough</p>
    <p>that i could share my heart without it feeling like a battle</p>
    <p>I hope one day you'll understand that my words came from love not from need to argue</p>
    <p>and all that all i ever wanted was for you to care enough to listen</p>
